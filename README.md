# InterestingDataStructures
A set of multiple datastructures, primitive and/or APIs I found  to interesting. Implemented in Java :pouting_cat:

Inspired by the [GTG] Goodrich, Tamassia, Goldwasser, “Data Structures and Algorithms in Java”, 6th edition, book I built these datastructures by hand (programatically obvi).

If you're in EECS1021, EECS2030, EECS2011 or EECS3101 you'll find the Golden Nugget useful. 

# Best of luck! :smiley_cat:

## This Repo covers:

1) Arrays 
2) Linked Lists 
3) ArrayLists 
4) PositionalList ==> (implemented using linked-list)
5) Stacks
6) Queues
7) Binary Trees ==> node now has parent, left and right as opposed to regular prev and next (implemented using linked-list)
8) PQ ==> entries (composition of (K,V)-pair) that have a priority, implemented using Heap (implemented using arrays). Introduces notion of Comparator to order keys which can of any type including objects.
9) Map==> associative arrays that store unique entries.
 9.1) Ordered sub-listUnsorted map ==> unsorted ArrayList of entries.
 9.2) Hashmap ==> array of linked list with some hashing function that used mod operator based on size of array used.
10) Graphs==> a way to represent relationship between two objects.
 10.1) Edge list
 10.2) Adjancency List
 10.3) Adjacdncy Map

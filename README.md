# InterestingDataStructures
A set of multiple datastructures, primitive and/or APIs I found  to interesting. Implemented in Java :pouting_cat:

Inspired by the [GTG] Goodrich, Tamassia, Goldwasser, “Data Structures and Algorithms in Java”, 6th edition, book I built these datastructures by hand (programatically obvi).

If you're in EECS1021, EECS2030, EECS2011 or EECS3101 you'll find the Golden Nugget useful. 

# Best of luck! :smiley_cat:
